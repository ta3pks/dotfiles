# Phase {N} — Validation Strategy

> Generated by `gsd-phase-researcher` during `/gsd-plan-phase {N}`.
> Updated by `gsd-plan-checker` after plan approval.
> Governs feedback sampling during `/gsd-execute-phase {N}`.

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | {pytest 7.x / jest 29.x / vitest / go test / other} |
| **Config file** | {path/to/pytest.ini or "none — Wave 0 installs"} |
| **Quick run command** | `{e.g., pytest -x --tb=short}` |
| **Full suite command** | `{e.g., pytest tests/ --tb=short}` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~{N} seconds |
| **CI pipeline** | {.github/workflows/test.yml — exists / needs creation} |

---

## Nyquist Sampling Rate

> The minimum feedback frequency required to reliably catch errors in this phase.

- **After every task commit:** Run `{quick run command}`
- **After every plan wave:** Run `{full suite command}`
- **Before `/gsd-verify-work`:** Full suite must be green
- **Maximum acceptable task feedback latency:** {N} seconds

## Per-Task Verification Map

| Task ID | Plan | Wave | Requirement | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| {N}-01-01 | 01 | 1 | REQ-{XX} | unit | `pytest tests/test_{module}.py::test_{name} -x` | ✅ / ❌ W0 | ⬜ pending |
| {N}-01-02 | 01 | 1 | REQ-{XX} | integration | `pytest tests/test_{flow}.py -x` | ✅ / ❌ W0 | ⬜ pending |
| {N}-02-01 | 02 | 2 | REQ-{XX} | smoke | `curl -s {endpoint} \| grep {expected}` | ✅ N/A | ⬜ pending |

*Status values: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky*

---

## Wave 0 Requirements

> Test scaffolding committed BEFORE any implementation task. Executor runs Wave 0 first.

- [ ] `{tests/test_file.py}` — stubs for REQ-{XX}, REQ-{XX}
- [ ] `{tests/conftest.py}` — shared fixtures
- [ ] `{framework install}` — if no framework detected

*If none required: "Existing infrastructure covers all phase requirements — no Wave 0 test tasks needed."*

---

## Manual-Only Verifications

> Behaviors that genuinely cannot be automated, with justification.
> These are surfaced during `/gsd-verify-work` UAT.

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| {behavior} | REQ-{XX} | {reason: visual, third-party auth, physical device...} | {step-by-step} |

*If none: "All phase behaviors have automated verification coverage."*

---

## Validation Sign-Off

Updated by `gsd-plan-checker` when plans are approved:

- [ ] All tasks have `<automated>` verify commands or Wave 0 dependencies
- [ ] No 3 consecutive implementation tasks without automated verify (sampling continuity)
- [ ] Wave 0 test files cover all MISSING references
- [ ] No watch-mode flags in any automated command
- [ ] Feedback latency per task: < {N}s ✅
- [ ] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Plan-checker approval:** {pending / approved on YYYY-MM-DD}

---

## Execution Tracking

Updated during `/gsd-execute-phase {N}`:

| Wave | Tasks | Tests Run | Pass | Fail | Sampling Status |
|------|-------|-----------|------|------|-----------------|
| 0 | {N} | — | — | — | scaffold |
| 1 | {N} | {command} | {N} | {N} | ✅ sampled |
| 2 | {N} | {command} | {N} | {N} | ✅ sampled |

**Phase validation complete:** {pending / YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
